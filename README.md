# Prepare-The-Day
 
## Description
"Prepare The Day" is a simple daily planner to help users keep track of the things they need to do for each hour of the day. At the top, the current month and day is displayed.

The grayed out slots reprisent the hours that have passed. The red slot is the currect hour. And the green slots are the future hours. 

To schedule an event, click on the green slots that match the time and write a brief description of the event. Then press the blue save icon on the right to save this event.
